### 👋 Hi, I'm Jörg Oyen – aka @joergoyen

🔍 I build tools and frameworks for connected thinking, learning and AI-assisted decision-making.

🧠 My focus:  
- Bridging analog and digital communication  
- Designing interfaces between people, processes and AI  
- Sprint-based learning architectures with structure, feedback and reflection  
- Using GPT, Firebase, and low-code tools for prototypes and concept validation

🚀 Selected projects:  
- 🧩 Quick T9 – a Chrome extension for fast, structured prompting  
- 🌍 AI Literacy Matrix – assessing and guiding AI maturity in education  
- 🗺 **MCP – Model Context Protocol**: a conceptual interface between applications and language models.  
  It structures prompts, roles, and context for more reliable AI-supported communication –  
  used across tools like Quick T9 and educational AI-sprints. Think of it as a language layer for generative systems, like REST for web services.
 
- 🧰 The Prompt Experience Board – a toolkit for adaptive, contextual prompting

📚 I'm also a university lecturer, L&D designer, and learning architect.
