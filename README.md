### 👋 Hi, I'm Jörg Oyen – aka @joergoyen

🔍 I build tools and frameworks for connected thinking, learning and AI-assisted decision-making.

🧠 My focus:  
- Bridging analog and digital communication  
- Designing interfaces between people, processes and AI  
- Sprint-based learning architectures with structure, feedback and reflection  
- Using GPT, Firebase, and low-code tools for prototypes and concept validation

🚀 Selected projects:  
- 🧩 Quick T9 – a Chrome extension for fast, structured prompting  
- 🌍 AI Literacy Matrix – assessing and guiding AI maturity in education  
- 🗺 MCP – Modular Communication Patterns for agile co-creation
